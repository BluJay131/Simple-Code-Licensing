## Description

A generator and client Python script to lock a scripts use based on time with a license key.

## Setup and Configuration

When using the generator script, you can select the time you want the key to expire up to the exact minute.
When the client inputs the key, (In my private example I used a config file), it is set up to close the cmd on expiry just as an example.

## Side Notes

- If you want actual security, you'll probably want to edit the generation and client-side scripts to decrypt and parse differently than this open source example.
